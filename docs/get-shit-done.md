# Get Shit Done (GSD)

Get Shit Done is a lightweight task specification format used here as the **intent contract** for AI agents.

## What it is

A versioned task file that defines:
- Goal
- Non-goals
- Constraints
- Acceptance criteria
- Definition of done
- Verification commands

## What it is not

- Not a ticketing system
- Not a project manager
- Not an AI framework

## Where it fits

GSD Task → Issue (links task) → Agent execution → Code + tests → PR review → Merge queue

GSD defines intent in text; tests make intent executable.
